This is a set of Jupyter notebooks designed to teach data science through project based work.  There is are cells left black with blue instructions on what code you need to write or edit to complete the exercise. Each problem set has a series of notebooks that steps through the Data Science Method (DSM). The DSM is a framework for approaching data science projects in a series of steps. Following these steps helps the beginner learn the life cycle of a data science project. Additionally, seasoned data professionals can find the DSM helpful in organizing their projects around clear communication of expected outcomes and reccomendations.  
**The Data Science Method**  


1.   Problem Identification 


2.   Data Wrangling 
  
 
3.   Exploratory Data Analysis   

4.   **Pre-processing and Training Data Development**  
 * Create dummy or indicator features for categorical variables
  * Standardize the magnitude of numeric features
  * Split into testing and training datasets
  * Apply scaler to the testing set
5.   Modeling 
  * Fit Models with Training Data Set
  * Review Model Outcomes â€” Iterate over additional models as needed.
  * Identify the Final Model

6.   Documentation
  * Review the Results
  * Present and share your findings - storytelling
  * Finalize Code 
  * Finalize Documentation
